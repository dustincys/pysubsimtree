# pysubsimtree


## Introduction

Pysubsim-tree is a bioinformatics tool written by Python for the simulation of
germline and somatic structural variations (SVs) such as deletions, insertions,
duplications, inversions, translocations, copy number variations (CNVs),
somatic copy number alternation(SCNA) and aneuploidy.  Pysubsim-tree could
phylogenetically simulate the subclonal population of tumor genome including
purity, aneuploidy and heterogeneity.

Pysubsim-tree could be run individually or strung with art_illumina, bwa and
samtools to generate Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) reads according to the
different cancer genomes, which can be mixed with specified proportions.
